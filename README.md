ABIPlayer is a DApp that provides UI to interact with contracts deployed with [solar](https://github.com/qtumproject/solar). You can use this UI to send/call methods of contracts.

This is what the ABI player looks like when an ERC20 token is loaded:

The gray buttons are readonly methods (call only). The blue buttons support both send and call.

# To Develop

Clone repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/htmcoin/htmlcoinjs-abiplayer.git my-project
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Start Neutrino dev server on port 3030:

```
PORT=3030 yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3030, and edit `src/index.tsx` for live-reload.

For styling, edit `src/index.css`.

Edit the [html](https://github.com/hayeah/neutrino-react-ts-boilerplate/blob/727d23b260935edd7a3b2c56d8e05ef616cec31c/.neutrinorc.js#L10) options to customize the HTML template. See [html-webpack-template](https://github.com/jaketrent/html-webpack-template/tree/624dd3931cc2ffaeed03962b25c61af81c2997e2#basic-usage).

## Other Tips

Generating sourcemap may slow down project rebuilding. Webpack provide other sourcemap types that can speed up project building.

In particular, the `eval` sourcemap is quite faster.

```
SOURCEMAP=eval PORT=3000 yarn start
```

See [devtool](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#devtool`) for a list of sourcemap types.
